  abstract: The prediction of molecular phenotypes from DNA sequences remains a longstanding
    challenge in genomics, often driven by limited annotated data and the inability
    to transfer learnings between tasks. Here, we present an extensive study of foundation
    models pre-trained on DNA sequences, named Nucleotide Transformer, ranging from
    50 million up to 2.5 billion parameters and integrating information from 3,202
    human genomes and 850 genomes from diverse species. These transformer models yield
    context-specific representations of nucleotide sequences, which allow for accurate
    predictions even in low-data settings. We show that the developed models can be
    fine-tuned at low cost to solve a variety of genomics applications. Despite no
    supervision, the models learned to focus attention on key genomic elements and
    can be used to improve the prioritization of genetic variants. The training and
    application of …

  abstract: Residue coevolution within and between proteins is used as a marker of
    physical interaction and/or residue functional cooperation. Pairs or groups of
    coevolving residues are extracted from multiple sequence alignments based on a
    variety of computational approaches. However, coevolution signals emerging in
    subsets of sequences might be lost if the full alignment is considered. iBIS2Analyzer
    is a web server dedicated to a phylogeny-driven coevolution analysis of protein
    families with different evolutionary pressure. It is based on the iterative version,
    iBIS2, of the coevolution analysis method BIS, Blocks in Sequences. iBIS2 is designed
    to iteratively select and analyse subtrees in phylogenetic trees, possibly large
    and comprising thousands of sequences. With iBIS2Analyzer, openly accessible at
    http://ibis2analyzer.lcqb.upmc.fr/, the user visualizes, compares and inspects
    clusters of coevolving residues by …

  abstract: Hedgehog (Hh) pathway inhibition by the conserved protein Suppressor of
    Fused (SuFu) is crucial to vertebrate development. By constrast, SuFu loss-of-function
    mutant has little effect in drosophila.Previous publications showed that the crystal
    structures of human and drosophila SuFu consist of two ordered domains that are
    capable of breathing motions upon ligand binding. However, the crystal structure
    of human SuFu does not give information about twenty N-terminal residues (IDR1)
    and an eighty-residue-long region predicted as disordered (IDR2) in the C-terminus,
    whose function is important for the pathway repression. These two intrinsically
    disordered regions (IDRs) are species-dependent.To obtain information about the
    IDR regions, we studied full-length SuFu’s structure in solution, both with circular
    dichroism and small angle X-ray scattering, comparing drosophila, zebrafish and
    human species, to better …

    specific domain targets. MyCLADE is a user-friendly webserver designed for targeted
    functional profiling of genomic and metagenomic sequences based on a database
    of a few million probabilistic models of Pfam domains. It uses the MetaCLADE multi-source
    domain annotation strategy, modelling domains based on multiple probabilistic

    of domains/clans as input and, for each sequence, it provides a domain architecture
    built from the targeted domains or from all Pfam domains. It is linked to the
    Pfam and QuickGO databases in multiple ways for easy retrieval of domain and clan
    information. E-value, bit-score, domain-dependent probability scores and logos

  journal: /9, 2020
  abstract: Gene order can be used as an informative character to reconstruct phylogenetic
    relationships between species independently from the local information present
    in gene/protein sequences. PhyChro is a reconstruction method based on chromosomal
    rearrangements, applicable to a wide range of eukaryotic genomes with different
    gene contents and levels of synteny conservation. For each synteny breakpoint
    issued from pairwise genome comparisons, the algorithm defines two disjoint sets
    of genomes, named partial splits, respectively, supporting the two block adjacencies
    defining the breakpoint. Considering all partial splits issued from all pairwise
    comparisons, a distance between two genomes is computed from the number of partial
    splits separating them. Tree reconstruction is achieved through a bottom-up approach
    by iteratively grouping sister genomes minimizing genome distances. PhyChro estimates …

  abstract: Overlapping genes are commonplace in viruses and play an important role
    in their function and evolution. For these genes, molecular coevolution may be
    seen as a mechanism to decrease the evolutionary constraints of amino acid positions
    in the overlapping regions and to tolerate or compensate unfavorable mutations.
    Tracing these mutational sites, could help to gain insight on the direct or indirect
    effect of the mutations in the corresponding overlapping proteins. In the past,
    coevolution analysis has been used to identify residue pairs and coevolutionary
    signatures within or between proteins that served as markers of physical interactions
    and/or functional relationships. Coevolution in OVerlapped sequences by Tree analysis
    (COVTree) is a web server providing the online analysis of coevolving amino-acid
    pairs in overlapping genes, where residues might be located inside or outside

  abstract: Along protein sequences, co-evolution analysis identifies residue pairs
    demonstrating either a specific co-adaptation, where changes in one of the residues
    are compensated by changes in the other during evolution or a less specific external
    force that affects the evolutionary rates of both residues in a similar magnitude.
    In both cases, independently of the underlying cause, co-evolutionary signatures
    within or between proteins serve as markers of physical interactions and/or functional
    relationships. Depending on the type of protein under study, the set of available
    homologous sequences may greatly differ in size and amino acid variability. BIS2Analyzer,

    designed for vertebrate and viral protein families, which typically display a

  journal: /6/8, 2017
  abstract: Transforming growth factors (TGF-βs) are proteins that regulate cell growth
    by binding to their receptors. In contrast to transforming growth factor (TGF)
    β1, TGF-β3 homodimer is believed to exist also in an open conformation, in which
    both of its monomers are loosely packed against each other. At the origin of this
    difference is the H3-helix. Its sequence and degree of structuration seem to govern
    the outcome of TGF dimerization. We docked two monomers of TGF-β3 with intact
    and altered H3 α-helix against each other using HADDOCK. TGF-β3 monomer with an
    intact H3-helix exclusively forms closed conformations of homodimer, whereas the
    open conformation may coexist with the closed one when a part of the H3 α-helix
    is destabilized. We quantify the difference in its conformational preference for
    the open versus the closed structure by calculating the binding energy between
    monomers using the MMPBSA …

  journal: /3/28, 2017
  abstract: Proteins have evolved to perform diverse cellular functions, from serving
    as reaction catalysts to coordinating cellular propagation and development. Frequently,
    proteins do not exert their full potential as monomers but rather undergo concerted
    interactions as either homo-oligomers or with other proteins as hetero-oligomers.
    The experimental study of such protein complexes and interactions has been arduous.
    Theoretical structure prediction methods are an attractive alternative. Here,
    we investigate homo-oligomeric interfaces by tracing residue coevolution via the
    global statistical direct coupling analysis (DCA). DCA can accurately infer spatial
    adjacencies between residues. These adjacencies can be included as constraints
    in structure prediction techniques to predict high-resolution models. By taking
    advantage of the ongoing exponential growth of sequence databases, we go significantly
    beyond anecdotal …

  abstract: Structural characterization of many important proteins and protein complexes-typically
    preceding any detailed mechanistic exploration of their function-remains experimentally
    challenging. Novel statistical tools such as Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) take
    advantage of the explosive growth of sequential databases and trace the co-evolution
    of amino acids to predict secondary and tertiary contacts for proteins [1] and
    RNAs [2]. These contacts can be exploited as spatial constraints in structure
    prediction workflows leading to excellent quality predictions [1, 2, 3, 4]. We
    demonstrate for two-component signal transduction systems (TCS), a ubiquitous
    signal response system, how different sub-families of TCS can be identified based
    on genomic data [unpublished data]. Going beyond anecdotal cases of a few protein
    families, we have applied our methods to a systematic large-scale study of nearly
    2000 PFAM protein …

  abstract: Coevolution of residues in contact imposes strong statistical constraints
    on the sequence variability between homologous proteins. Direct-Coupling Analysis
    (DCA), a global statistical inference method, successfully models this variability
    across homologous protein families to infer structural information about proteins.
    For each residue pair, DCA infers 21× 21 matrices describing the coevolutionary
    coupling for each pair of amino acids (or gaps). To achieve the residue-residue
    contact prediction, these matrices are mapped onto simple scalar parameters; the
    full information they contain gets lost. Here, we perform a detailed spectral
    analysis of the coupling matrices resulting from 70 protein families, to show
    that they contain quantitative information about the physico-chemical properties
    of amino-acid interactions. Results for protein families are corroborated by the
    analysis of synthetic data from lattice-protein models …

  abstract: Statins are largely used in clinics in the treatment of patients with
    cardiovascular diseases for their effect on lowering circulating cholesterol.
    Lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LOX-1), the primary receptor for
    ox-LDL, plays a central role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular
    disorders. We have recently shown that chronic exposure of cells to lovastatin
    disrupts LOX-1 receptor cluster distribution in plasma membranes, leading to a
    marked loss of LOX-1 function. Here we investigated the molecular mechanism of
    statin-mediated LOX-1 inhibition and we demonstrate that all tested statins are
    able to displace the binding of fluorescent ox-LDL to LOX-1 by a direct interaction
    with LOX-1 receptors in a cell-based binding assay. Molecular docking simulations
    confirm the interaction and indicate that statins completely fill the hydrophobic
    tunnel that crosses the C-type lectin-like (CTLD …

    to oxygen and carbon monoxyde. Moreover, the presence of a putative transmembrane
    helix and protein-DDM interaction represent two challenging features to efficiently
    immobilize the protein on the electrode surface.

  abstract: The mitochondrial adenosine diphosphate/adenosine triphosphate (ADP/ATP)
    carrier—AAC—was crystallized in complex with its specific inhibitor carboxyatractyloside
    (CATR). The protein consists of a six-transmembrane helix bundle that defines
    the nucleotide translocation pathway, which is closed towards the matrix side
    due to sharp kinks in the odd-numbered helices. In this paper, we describe the
    interaction between the matrix side of the AAC transporter and the ATP4− molecule
    using carrier structures obtained through classical molecular dynamics simulation
    (MD) and a protein–ligand docking procedure. Fifteen structures were extracted
    from a previously published MD trajectory through clustering analysis, and 50
    docking runs were carried out for each carrier conformation, for a total of 750
    runs (“MD docking”). The results were compared to those from 750 docking runs
    performed on the X-ray …

  abstract: Three nanocages composed of 12 DNA double helices, linked by single strand
    thymidine linkers made by 3, 5, and 7 nucleotides, have been characterized through
    classical molecular dynamics simulation to evaluate in silico the specific structural
    and conformational features generated by the use of a thymidine bridge of different
    length. The three simulated nanocages are stable, and their dynamics is characterized
    by a slight rotational motion of the double helices, induced by the conformational
    variations of the thymidine linkers. Despite this rotation the helices maintain
    a B-DNA structure as indicated by the values of their geometrical parameters.
    The thymidine strands are the elements having the largest displacement from the
    initial 3D model and give a significant contribution to the organization of the
    scaffold geometry throughout definite arrangements of base stacking and hydrogen
    bonds between the bases …

  abstract: DNA-binding proteins from starved cells (Dps) differ in the number and
    position of charged residues along the “ferritin-like” pores that are used by
    iron to reach the ferroxidase center and the protein cavity. These differences
    are shown to affect significantly the electrostatic potential at the pores, which
    determines the extent of cooperativity in the iron uptake kinetics and thereby
    the mass distribution of the ferric hydroxide micelles inside the protein cavity.
    These conclusions are of biotechnological value in the preparation of protein-enclosed
    nanomaterials and are expected to apply also to ferritins. They were reached after
    characterization of the Dps from Listeria innocua, Helicobacter pylori, Thermosynechococcus
    elongatus, Escherichia coli, and Mycobacterium smegmatis. The characterization
    comprised the calculation of the electrostatic potential at the pores, determination
    of the iron uptake kinetics in the …

  abstract: Warfarin (coumadin) is a worldwide-prescribed anticoagulant, largely used
    for the long-term treatment and for the prevention of thromboembolic events. However,
    it needs a constant clinical follow-up due to its narrow therapeutic range and
    due to the greater interindividual variability in the drug dose required to achieve
    the therapeutic effect. The correct dosing is necessary to avoid bleeding or risk
    of thrombotic events in case of an excessive or a too low dose, respectively.
    The interindividual variability in the warfarin requirement is a multifactorial
    character and both environmental and genetic factors influence the dose necessary
    for the therapeutic effect. Many pharmacogenetic studies have shown that polymorphic
    alleles within CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genes are related to warfarin dose requirement
    [1–3] as well as a new recently identified common variation (rs2108622) in the
    CYP4F2 gene [4, 5].

  abstract: Comparative homology modelling techniques have been used to model the
    protein ZnuA from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium using the 3D structure
    of the homologous protein from Escherichia coli. These two-domain proteins bind
    one Zn2+ atom, with high affinity, in the inter-domain cleft and possess a histidine-rich
    loop in the N-terminal domain. Alternative structures of the ZnuA histidine-rich
    loop, never resolved by the X-ray diffraction method, have been modelled. A model
    of the apo form, one with the histidine-rich loop deleted and two alternative
    structures with a second zinc ion bound to the histidine-rich loop, have been
    generated. In all the modelled proteins, investigated through molecular dynamics
    simulation, the histidine-rich loop is highly mobile and its fluctuations are
    correlated to the ligand stability observed in the zinc sites. Based on the plasticity
    of the histidine-rich loop and its …

  abstract: Conjugated eicosapentaenoic acid inhibits the relaxation activity of purified
    L. donovani topoisomerase I, with an efficiency higher than that displayed by
    the corresponding human enzyme. Docking of the acid compound over the 3D structure
    of the enzyme shows that the complex is stabilized by a large network of interaction
    between the compound and many residues located in proximity of the active site,
    including the catalytic tyrosine 222, providing an explanation for its efficient
    inhibitory effect. The acid has also a strong antiprotozoal activity against L.
    donovani promastigotes (EC50= 75 µM) whilst it has no effect against murine macrophages
    (IC50 2 mM). Taken together the results indicate that L. donovani topoisomerase
    I can be considered an interesting molecular target and that conjugated eicosapentaenoic
    acid can be taken in consideration as a possible lead compound against leishmaniasis.

  abstract: The assembly, structure, and stability of DNA nanocages with the shape
    of truncated octahedra have been studied. The cages are composed of 12 double-stranded
    B-DNA helices interrupted by single-stranded linkers of thymidines of varying
    length that constitute the truncated corners of the structure. The structures
    assemble with a high efficiency in a one-step procedure, compared to previously
    published structures of similar complexity. The structures of the cages were determined
    by small-angle X-ray scattering. With increasing linker length, there is a systematic
    increase of the cage size and decrease of the twist angle of the double helices
    with respect to the symmetry planes of the cage structure. In the present study,
    we demonstrate the length of the single-stranded linker regions, which impose
    a certain degree of flexibility to the structure, to be the important determinant
    for efficient assembly. The linker length …

  abstract: A DNA nanocage has been recently characterized by small-angle X-ray scattering
    (SAXS) and cryo-transmission electron microscopy as a DNA octahedron having a
    central cavity larger than the apertures in the surrounding DNA lattice. Starting
    from the SAXS data, a DNA nanocage has been modeled and simulated by classical
    molecular dynamics to evaluate in silico its structural properties and stability.
    Global properties, principal component analysis, and DNA geometrical parameters,
    calculated along the entire trajectory, indicate that the cage is stable and that
    the B-DNA conformation, also if slightly distorted, is maintained for all the
    simulation time. Starting from the initial model, the nanocage scaffold undergoes
    a contraction of the thymidine strands, connecting the DNA double helices, suggesting
    that the length of the thymidine strands is a crucial aspect in the modulation
    of the nanocage stability. A …

  abstract: Conjugated eicosapentaenoic acid (cEPA) has been found to have antitumor
    effects which has been ascribed to their ability to inhibit DNA topoisomerases
    and DNA polymerases. We here show that cEPA inhibits the catalytic activity of
    human topoisomerase I, but unlike camptothecin it does not stabilize the cleavable
    complex, indicating a different mechanism of action. cEPA inhibits topoisomerase
    by impeding the catalytic cleavage of the DNA substrate as demonstrated using
    specific oligonucleotide substrates, and prevents the stabilization of the cleavable
    complex by camptothecin. Preincubation of the inhibitor with the enzyme is required
    to obtain complete inhibition. Molecular docking simulations indicate that the
    preferred cEPA binding site is proximal to the active site with the carboxylic
    group strongly interacting with the positively charged K443 and K587. Taken together
    the results indicate that cEPA inhibitor …

    principal component analysis, and geometrical and energetic DNA analyses indicate
    that the two transcription factors utilize a different strategy in DNA recognition
